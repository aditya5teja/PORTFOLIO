            <h1> ABOUT</h1>
            <h2>Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock.
                 <br>It includes the preparation of plant and animal products for people to use and their distribution to markets. 
                 <br>Agriculture provides most of the world's food and fabrics.Over centuries, the growth of agriculture contributed to the rise of civilizations.

                 Before agriculture became widespread, people spent most of their lives searching for food—hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants.
                  About 11,500 years ago, people gradually learned how to grow cereal and root crops, and settled down to a life based on farming.
                 
                 By 2,000 years ago, much of the Earth’s population had become dependent on agriculture. Scholars are not sure why this shift to farming took place, 
                 but it may have occurred because of climate change.
                 
                 When people began growing crops, they also began herding and breeding wild animals. Adapting wild plants and animals for people to use is called domestication.
                 
                 The first domesticated plant was probably rice or corn. Chinese farmers were cultivating rice as early as 7500 BCE.
                 
                 The first domesticated animals were dogs, which were used for hunting. Sheep and goats were probably domesticated next.
                  People also domesticated cattle and pigs. Most of these animals had once been hunted for hides and meat. Now many of them are also sources of milk, cheese, and butter.
                   Eventually, people used domesticated animals such as oxen for plowing, pulling, and transportation.
                 
                 Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. They could use this extra food when crops failed or trade it for other goods. 
                 Food surpluses allowed people to work at other tasks unrelated to farming.
                 
                 Agriculture kept formerly nomadic people near their fields and led to the development of permanent villages. These became linked through trade.
                  New economies were so successful in some areas that cities grew and civilizations developed. The earliest civilizations based on intensive agriculture
                   arose near <br>the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in Mesopotamia (now Iraq and Iran) and along the Nile River in Egypt.</h2>

                   <h2>At present it is difficult to keep on identifying the pest which is affecting the crop in a field manually..
                    sometimes pest may not affect the entire crop by which spraying pesticides for the whole crop will be unnecessary.
                   The crop grown in the field should be suitable to the type of the soil . Different types of crops need different  nutritions for its growth in which we have to use fertilizers to have fertile soil
                   For this we need a soil fertility test.
                   The usage for fertilizers and pesticides is growing day by day by which chemical usage is growing which affects the health 
                   To reduce the pesticides usage and to grow suitable crop for the soil this product will be perfect
                   At present we don’t have device for observing the evolution of the plant growth which can be used for research purposes..</h2>
